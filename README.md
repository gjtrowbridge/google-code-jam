#####Motivation

Very few people use JavaScript for [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam) (yes, Java/C++ are faster, but my guess is that this probably won't make a difference for most of the coding challenges).

#####About

So, I decided to build some boilerplate code so JS users (or, more likely, just me) don't have to worry about the annoying input/output parts of JavaScript, and can run their code as easily as the Java/C++ crew.

#####To Use

* Make sure `node` is installed on your computer

* Clone this repository to your computer

* Move to the repository's directory

* Run `npm install`

* Then, simply `require('./code-jam-boilerplate.js')` in the code you write, and you can do simple input/output on the command line!

* For example, run `node example_solution.js example_input.txt example_output.txt`

#####Good News!

I wasn't sure if this was allowed.  But it [IS](https://code.google.com/codejam/faq.html#4-6)! WOOP WOOP!  So I'd encourage everyone who's interested to use this in Google Code Jam.
